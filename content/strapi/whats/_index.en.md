Strapi is an open-source, Node.js based, Headless CMS that saves developers a lot of development time while giving them the freedom to use their favorite tools and frameworks. Itâ€™s 100% Javascript, fully customizable and developer-first. Strapi also enables content editors to streamline content delivery (text, images, video, etc) across any devices.

A headless CMS is a back-end only content management system (CMS) built from the ground up as a content repository that makes content accessible via an API for display on any device.

Headless CMS are also particularly suitable for websites designed using the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/strapi/) model where JavaScript, APIs, and Markup work together to make web development easier and user experiences better.
