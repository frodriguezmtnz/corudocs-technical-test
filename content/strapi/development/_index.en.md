For the moment, we are going to use the `npm run develop` command in our terminal to launch in **develop mode** Strapi with an admin panel as backend.

```bash
npm run develop
```

Once launched, it will tell us a local address with a port, such as: `localhost:1337/admin`, where we can enter and finish configuring Strapi:

![strapi npm run develop](http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1fjKJvXLULiAIAN-TCaiLz5c2WuDpdEV8)

Follow the installation steps that Strapi asks for, to finalize the configuration of an administrator user and start using Strapi as Headless CMS.

![strapi register user](http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1z7U6cqsFTQo_56z1pIWuGNitbOWuep5C)

![strapi logged backend](http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1fwYlnFYUSuIFJ3A8wHLtc0mxBMOC6G3l)

If you have made it this far:

**Congratulations! You have successfully configured Strapi v.4 locally.** ðŸ¥³

Now you can continue configuring the tool to your liking, project needs, or learn more thanks to the official ["Strapi User Guide"](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/intro) on their website.
