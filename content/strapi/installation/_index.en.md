Open your favorite terminal, and place it in the Development (DEV) folder you usually use. We are going to install Stripe v4 locally in a new folder on our computer.

To do this, execute the following commands:

```bash
mkdir strapicorunet && cd strapicorunet
```

![imagen mkdir strapi folder](http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1a75-UvM96jlLamtZr2cBsyfyQ2nkAg4B)

```bash
npx create-strapi-app@latest strapi-corunet --quickstart
```

{{% notice note %}}
'npx' runs a command from an npm package.

'create-strapi-app' is the Strapi package.

'@latest' indicates that the latest version of Strapi is used 'strapi-corunet' is the name of your Strapi project

--quickstart: Directly create the project in quickstart mode.

The script will ask us whether to install or configure by default certain features of Strapi, for the moment, we configure everything as "recommended" and click continue (yes/y).

Once the installation is finished, Strapi will be installed locally on your computer.
